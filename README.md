# Perfect Circle Bot for Neal.fun

This is a Python script that uses the Playwright library to automatically draw a circle on the [Perfect Circle game](https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/) by Neal Agarwal. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by drawing a geometrically precise and smoothly executed circle.

## Features

- **Automated Browser Control**: Launches a Chromium browser and navigates to the game automatically.
- **High-Precision Drawing**: Calculates hundreds of points (vertices) to approximate a perfect circle.
- **Smooth Mouse Movement**: Uses Playwright's built-in `steps` functionality to simulate a smooth, continuous mouse drag instead of jumping between points.
- **Auto-Retry Logic**: If the score is too low or the attempt is "Too slow," the script will automatically close the page and start a new attempt.
- **Success Screenshot**: Upon successfully drawing a high-scoring circle, the script takes a screenshot of the result.
- **Auto-Open Result**: The saved screenshot is automatically opened with your system's default image viewer.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- `pip` (Python package installer).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the environment ready.

**1. Get the files**

Clone this repository or download the files (`circulo_perfect.py` and `requirements.txt`) into a new directory on your computer.

```bash
# Example if using git
git clone [https://your-repository-url.com/perfect-circle-bot.git](https://your-repository-url.com/perfect-circle-bot.git)
cd perfect-circle-bot
```

**2. Install Python Dependencies**

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's directory and run the following command to install the required Python library.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Install Playwright Browsers**

Playwright requires browser binaries to function. After installing the Python package, you must run the following command to download the necessary browser (this script uses Chromium).

```bash
playwright install
```

This command only needs to be run once.

## How to Run

Once the setup is complete, you can run the bot with this simple command:

```bash
python perfect_circle.py
```

A Chromium browser window will open, navigate to the page, and start drawing. The script will run in a loop, making attempts until it achieves a successful result. When finished, it will save and open a screenshot and the browser will close after a 5-second delay.
